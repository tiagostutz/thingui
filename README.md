## Ok, what's the main idea?
The idea is to build, organize and compose the UI component as if they were IoT devices. For example, think of a stream feed page like the ones you see in Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc as if it was an analogic panel with devices plugged into it. Each feed item would be a device containing a display with feed information, a speaker to play its sound - if may -, buttons to do actions like filter, sort, star, like and so on. Check this:
